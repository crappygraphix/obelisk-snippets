# Obelisk/Reflex-Dom Snippets

The goal is to provide examples of common frontend usecases, not to be a reference manual for reflex/reflex-dom functions.

## Layout

Each page consists of the following key areas.

1. Key Tools - List functions and nuances of interest.
2. Imports of Note - Any imports that may not be obvious.
3. Examples - The examples.

Each example consists of the following areas.

1. Example - A working example of the widget. Some scenarios may not have this, such as importing resources or routing.
2. Code - The code to duplicate the shown example along with explanations.

### Notes
- Use `ob run` to see the pages.
- Imports Bootstrap 4's CSS for convenience.
- Collapsible Content is a complete representation of the desired output.
- No not "link to source" in the examples. It is by design that the code and example exist within the same visual context.
